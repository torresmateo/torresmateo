### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on computational biology, mostly [protein function prediction](https://www.biofunctionprediction.org/). You can follow most of the projects and tools development at the [PaccanaroLab](https://paccanarolab.org) website.

📫 The best way to keep updated with my work or reach me is through the profiles listed on [my website](https://torresmateo.com).

I also run a study group that focuses on Machine Learning, covering [the PRML book By C. Bishop](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/)(the streams are in Spanish, more details [here](https://torresmateo.com/prml))
