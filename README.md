ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computational biology, mostly [protein function prediction](https://www.biofunctionprediction.org/). You can follow most of the projects and tools development at the [PaccanaroLab](https://paccanarolab.org) website.

ðŸ“« The best way to keep updated with my work or reach me is through the profiles listed on [my website](torresmateo.com).
